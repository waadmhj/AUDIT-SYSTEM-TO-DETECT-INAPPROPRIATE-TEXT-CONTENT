# AUDIT-SYSTEM-TO-DETECT-INAPPROPRIATE-TEXT-CONTENT

The System's goal is to safeguard children from harmful text that may have a negative impact on them. It achieves this by training a model to differentiate words that should be hidden from children from other words. This includes identifying positive and negative words, as well as words that should be filtered out to ensure children cannot see them.
